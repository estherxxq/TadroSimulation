# TadroSimulation
This is a simulation of Tadro system at Vassar College, compatible with the Tadro version used for URSI 2017.  

# Current features


# Running the code
The code is written in R and requires R studio and corresponding packages to run. The animation component also requires a .gif maker, such as ImageMagick.  
Download the repository, open the .Rproj file in R studio.  
Check and set the parameters in Parameters.R.  
Run everything in the TadroModel2017.R file. This should result in a data set for a trial and a plot of Tadro's trial.   
You can then generate animations of the trial and network activation patterns in the Animation.R file.  
  
More detailed description to come.
